Use of `end` in `print()`  
The `end` parameter decides what to add **at the end** of the printed line instead of a new line (`\n`).  

Example:  
print("Hello World", end=", ")  
print("How are you?")  

Output:
Hello World, How are you?  


Logical Operators  
Logical operators help check multiple conditions and say **yes (True)** or **no (False)**.  
1. and 
   - Says "yes" only if **both conditions are true**.  
   - Example:   
     print(5 > 3 and 4 > 2)  # Yes, both are true  
2. or
   - Says "yes" if **at least one condition is true**.  
   - Example:   
     print(5 > 3 or 4 < 2)  # Yes, one is true  
3. not 
   - Flips the answer: "yes" becomes "no," and "no" becomes "yes."  
   - Example:  
     print(not(5 > 3))  # No, it flips "yes" to "no"
